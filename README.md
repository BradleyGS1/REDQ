# Randomised Ensemble Double Q-function (REDQ) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

## Overview

This project implements the Randomised Ensemble Double Q-function (REDQ) algorithm with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as the base algorithm. 
Tensorflow 2 is the deep learning ecosystem of choice for this project. REDQ is a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to improve the stability and sample efficiency of SAC by employing a randomized 
ensemble approach.
